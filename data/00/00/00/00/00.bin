  |   Story of a Gladiator is an arena beat 'em up where you take the       |
  |   role of a man in search of his destiny, only to find it in the        |
  |   sands of the colosseum.                                               |

  |   worse. You spend much of your time in the streets of Rome looking     |
  |   for some sort of meaning in your life and wondering why the gods      |
  |   have spared you. One day fate finally reveals itself, are you ready   |
  |   to accept it?                                                         |
